# Herding-Problem

This repository contains the implementation of a novel control strategy developed for coordinating dog-like robots to herd sheep-like agents towards a specified goal region within an environment. The strategy is applicable to herding robotic sheep-like agents, which react to the dog-like robots with a repelling potential field similar to those observed in natural herding behavior.
